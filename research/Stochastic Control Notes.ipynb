The MM provides liquidity to the limit order book (LOB) by posting buy and sell LOs and the control variable is the depth, which is measured from the midprice, at which these LOs are posted. To formalise the problem, we list the relevant variables that we use throughout this section:\n",

For each round-trip of buying and selling, we make the spread $\\delta^+_t + \\delta^-_t$. Our PnL depends on making as many of such round trips as possible, while at the same time managing the risk of inventory.\n",
    " - $(M_t^{\\pm})_{0\\le t\\le T}$ denote counting processes corresponding to the arrival of buy $(+)$ and sell $(-)$ market orders (MOs), which arrive at Poisson times with intensity $\\lambda^{\\pm}$.\n",

    " - condition on the arrival of a market order (MO), the posted LOs are filled with probability $e^{-\\kappa^\\pm \\delta^\\pm_t}$, with $\\kappa^\\pm > 0$. This means that the fill rate of LOs is given by $\\Lambda_t^{\\delta, \\pm}=\\lambda^\\pm e^{-\\kappa^\\pm \\delta^\\pm_t}$. Intuitively, $\\lambda^\\pm$ is the arrival rate, and also the probability of a jump. This is modulated by the probability of being filled when posting at depth $\\delta^\\pm_t$, $e^{-\\kappa^\\pm \\delta^\\pm_t}$, to give $\\Lambda_t^{\\delta, \\pm}$.\n",
