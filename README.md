# BATS PITCH Parser
Simple C++ BATS PITCH message parser built using the Boost Spirit framework. 

Mainly as a proof-of-concept. Not aiming for HFT-grade code - although I know how to do C with inline-assembly if I wanted to. Just using this to learn the spirit framework and hoping to keep the code simple and neat and fast enough :)
